# Filter Pattern

### What's the problem?
Sometimes in your application, you may have a list of objects that you want to filter them.<br />
There are some ways to do this trick. For example each programming language has a filter method for its lists
that would do this for us.

But in here, we want to show how we can create one for our own.
 
Take a look at the following UML diagram representing the Filter design pattern (for my example):
